Just staggered out of the theater, feeling like my brain's just been through the blender. Riff Raff. What the hell did I just 𝘸𝘢𝘵𝘤𝘩? I’m tired. And kind of wired. You know that feeling when you've just woken up but dream logic still makes sense? That’s now. It was like a circus without a tent, chaotic and a little smelly, but you can't decide if it's charming or if someone needs to burn it all down. 

Honestly, the characters? Total trainwrecks. Could you even call them characters? More like these glimpses of people thrown together in a washing machine of... I dunno, existential dirt. 

> The plot? Ha! Plot is optional, right? Seriously though, it was like trying to build a sandcastle in the middle of a tornado. Every time I thought I grasped what they were doing, it was like, nope, just kidding, here’s more madness. And yet, I can’t help but feel... weirdly affectionate towards the whole mess? 

Monologues were everywhere but didn’t say much. It reminded me of when my grandpa used to lecture us on the good ol’ days, except grandpa didn’t have a thick Scottish accent (or did he in my mind during this  ?!). Because accents. So many, I kinda wanted 𝘴𝘶𝘣𝘵𝘪𝘵𝘭𝘦s. Or a translator. Or both. Or just a big sign saying ‘good luck.’

I'm not even sure if it was good or bad. Reminds me of that time I tried eating kale without convincing myself first that it was food—like, repulsive yet oddly satisfying. Maybe don't 𝘥𝘰𝘸𝘯𝘭𝘰𝘢𝘥 the   if you’re sober. A little mental preparation is required. Maybe a couple of beers. Or six.

Why did they light that one scene like a bad garage sale? And it worked. Sort of. Like using a spoon to eat soup, technically correct but so annoyingly insufficient. Quick shot of a construction site and I thought, ah, symbolism! What's it symbolize? Who the hell knows? Build your own conclusions, I guess.

int main() {
    printf(Welcome to the Riff Raff Circus!
);
    return 0;
}

Oh yeah, and music. Soundtrack was somewhere between brilliant and headache-inducing. Kind of like the time that band tried to play a lullaby at the circus and you’re like, okay, I’ll vibe with this... I guess. All their decisions felt accidental yet composed. Call it accidental art.

Would I 𝘸𝘢𝘵𝘤𝘩 it again? Maybe, if I was stuck inside an armory of silly string. There's something magnetic about the chaos. Or I just enjoy self-punishment—could be that too.
